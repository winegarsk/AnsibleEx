# Choice of Content Management System

# Status: accepted

# Context: 

Module 1 requires a server based content management system that will
connect the mysql database with a front end app. Php-apache was chosen, 
as well as a mysqli plugin that allows connection to back end. 

# Decision:

Php-apache along with mysqli plugin is a widely known and accepted environment
that pairs nicely with mysql. 

# Consequences: 

Minimal effort is required to make the environment operational.
